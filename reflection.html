        <h1>My Thoughts in Life</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I always wondered why life is so unfair. There are people who live wealthy lives and die wealthy, but I feel like the world is particularly unfair to me. I have to struggle so much just to say, “This is life.” I know everyone has a purpose, but I don’t understand what my purpose is. I know there are people out there with even greater problems than mine, but they manage to cope, while I can’t seem to think positively or stay motivated. I always think negatively and worry about the future, even when it’s not something I need to be concerned about. I wonder why I’m like this. I just want to live happily without worrying about what will happen today or tomorrow. Do I really need to suffer? Do I deserve all of this?</p>
        
        <p>As I grow older, my problems seem to get bigger. Adulting has made me realize that it’s all about being strong and not giving up on life. It’s not just about financial matters but also about the unity and happiness of our family. I’ve never experienced seeing my family truly happy. Why can’t we make that happen again? I question whether being alive is really fortunate. Some things can’t be fixed, which leads to anxiety and depression. I break down with every problem I face, but I keep fighting and continuing the life I’ve started. I hope my problems will eventually come and go, just like people do.</p>

        <p>I want a peaceful and happy life. I believe that one day, God will give me what’s meant for me. I will do my best to head in the right direction. Life isn’t easy, but I trust in God. May all our hard work lead us to success.</p>
